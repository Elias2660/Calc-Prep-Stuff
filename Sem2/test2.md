### Solving Differential Equations

1. What is a differential equation and what is the solution to a differential equation like?
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

2. What is the difference between a general vs and specific solution.
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

3. Find the general solution to $\frac{dy}{dx} = x + xy$, and then the specific solution passing through [1, 5]
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

4. Find the equation for the curve passing through (0,3) whose tangent line is at (x, y) has slope 2x/y.
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

5. Solve through separation of variables:

   1. $\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2} dy}{1+y dx} = -x$.
      <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

   2. $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2}{2y + cos y}$

### Euler's Methods Approximation

1. Let y = f(x), f(0) = 2, use Euler's method with a step size of 1/2 to approximate f(1).
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>
2. Use 10 steps of Euler's method to determine an approximate solution for the diffential equation $y'=x^3, y(0)=0$ using a step size of 0.1.
