 # Hiller '23 - '24 Resources

Here are some of the questions that I used to prepare for Hiller's tests. To print out the markdown files, download [GitHub Markdown Printer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-markdown-printer/fehpdlpmcegfpbkgcnaleindodeegapk) to print them out.

Good luck!
