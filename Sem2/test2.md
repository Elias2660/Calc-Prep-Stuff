2. What is the difference between a general vs and specific solution.
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

3. Find the general solution to $\frac{dy}{dx} = x + xy$, and then the specific solution passing through [1, 5]
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

4. Find the equation for the curve passing through (0,3) whose tangent line is at (x, y) has slope 2x/y.
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

5. Solve through separation of variables:

   1. $\frac{\sqrt{1+x^2} dy}{1+y dx} = -x$.
      <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

   2. $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2}{2y + cos y}$

### Euler's Methods Approximation

1. Let y = f(x), f(0) = 2, use Euler's method with a step size of 1/2 to approximate f(1).
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>
2. Use 10 steps of Euler's method to determine an approximate solution for the diffential equation $y'=x^3, y(0)=0$ using a step size of 0.1.

   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

2. The half life of hydrocodone Bitartrate in the body is 3.8 hours and the typical dose is 10mg. The quantity of the drug decreases at a rate proportional to the amount left in the body. How much is left after 12 hours?
   <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>

3. The normal temperature of a human body is 37 degress Celsius. A detective finds a murder victim at 4pm and notes that the body's temperature is 28 degress celsius , and that the air temperature was 20 degress celsius. Two hours later, the body's temperature was 24 degrees celsius.When did the murder occcur
